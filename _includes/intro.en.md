From **Patagonia to the mountains of Mexico**, communities are uprising. They denounce the **destruction of their territories and their lives**. Drawing on their cultural heritage, they organize themselves to stop the carnage and to **create inspiring solutions**. The documentary Minga is an echo of these voices of resistance.

Pauline and Damien spent **two years with them** and let them have total freedom of speech. The shooting was done with the smallest ecological footprint possible (land and sea routes only).
